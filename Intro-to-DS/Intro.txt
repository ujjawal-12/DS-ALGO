--------------------------DS INTRODUCTION--------------------
> Data Structure is a particilar way to organize the data in a 
sequential manner which can be used effecientlly.
> The concept of DS also boosting the programming skill of
 any programmer.
> It also helps us to face real world problem when we have 
large amount of data it guide us how to store these data in 
programming world to manage them properly with ex of 
ds(stack,queue,linked list).
> By using the concept of ds we can make our program flexible
 and efficent .
> It tells about Time complexites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Types of Data Structure.
1.)Linear (Dynamic array,linked list,stack,queue)
2.)non Linear  (Tree,Graph)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Linear DS

1.)Dynamic array->It is a special type of array which store collection 
of data in sequentially and whenever need to increase the size of array.
it increase at run time double of its original size.
     
      ## Operation in Dynamic array
a.) insert()
b.) update()
c.) remove()
d.) view()

2.)Linked List->  Linked list is linear DS. where the data stored in collection of node cointainig two block one for stored data and second one is pointer which point to next node .
and every node is connectd each other via pointer.

Types of linked list:-
a.)Linked list.
b.)Doubly Linked list.
c.)Circular Linke list.
d.)Circular doubly linked list.

 ##Operation in Dynamic array
a.) insert()
b.) update()
c.) remove()
d.) view()

3.) Stack -> Stack is linear data structure which store data in linear. which follow LIFO principal (last in first first out).

 ##Operation in Dynamic array
a.) Push()
c.) Pop()
c.)Isfull()
d.) view()
e.)Peek()

##Application of stack.
- Stacks can be used for expression evaluation.
- Stacks can be used to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
- Stacks can be used for Conversion from one form of expression to another.
- Stacks can be used for Memory Management.

4.)Queue-> Queue is linear data structure which store data in linear. which follow FIFO principal (first  in first out).

##Operation in Dynamic array
a.) enqueue()
c.) dequeue()
c.)Isfull()
d.) view()
e.)Peek()

##Application of Queue.
-Cpu Scheduling.
-Memory management.

------------------------------Sorting-----------------------
Sorting-> Sorting is a process of arrangging a data in some logical manner.
                Sorting of any numeric data bydefault from lower to higher value.
                Sorting of alphabetical bydefault in dictionary manner

# Sorting are two type:-
a.)External Sorting.
          -->External sorting are those sorting in which data are very large amount and at a time all are not stored any program in that type data are come in chunks by chunks (streaming) and after that sorting process happend that is called external sorting.
b.)Internal Sorting.
        -->internal sorting are those sorting in data are not bulky and stored in program and soritng process happend.

    ## Types of Internal sorting:-
    a.)Bubble Sort.
    b.)Modified Bubble sort.
    c.)Selection Sort.
    d.)Insertion Sort.
    e.)Quick Sort.
    f.)Merge sort.
    g.)Heap Sort.

----------------------------------Searching-----------------------------------

Searching-> searching is a technique to find a desired item  among various list of item.

## we can do searching by two ways:-
a.)Linear Search.
b.)Binary Search.
